		<h2>First of two Mandela events</h2>
		<p>The Nelson Mandela 70th Tribute was a popular music concert staged on 11th of june 1988 at wembley stadium, london, and broadcasted to 67 countries and an audience of 600 million. Marking the forthcoming 70th birthday (18th of july, 1988) of the imprisoned anti-apartheid revolutionary Nelson Mandela, the concert was also referred to as Freedom fest, Free Nelson Mandela Concert and Mandela Day. In the United States, the Fox television network heavily censored the political aspects of the concert.
		The concert is considered a notable example of anti-apartheid music.</p>

		<p>The birthday tribute was regarded by many, including the Anti Apartheid Movement(AAM) and the African National Congress(ANC), as raising worldwide consciousness of the imprisonment of the ANC leader Mandela and others by the South African apartheid government and forcing the regime to release Nelson mandela earlier than would otherwise have happened.</p>

		<p>Eightneen months after the event, with a release now thought to be approaching, Mandela asked for the organizers of the event to create a second concert as an official international reception at whix, after 27 years in prison, he would address the world. The second event, Nelson Mandela. An International Tribute for a Free South Africa, was,like the first, conceived to be shown on television across the world and was broadcast from Wembley Stadium to more than 60 countries on 16 April 1990</p>
